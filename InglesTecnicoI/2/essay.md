Bill Gates is one of the wealthiest people in the world, and one of the best
known entrepreneurs in the technology revolution.

Here are his 10 rules for success:

1. Have energy: It should be enough to overcome your feeling of risk, and it
   should give you motivation to overcome problems.
2. Have a bad influence: He was a school drop out, and he made Steve Ballmer to
   drop out too.
3. Work hard: He dedicates 2 full weeks just to go off and read. He spends
   a lot of time traveling, meeting with costumers, and trying to make his
   company better.
4. Create the future: He had visualized the windows concept back in 1983.
5. Enjoy what you do: He enjoyed working with smart people, and working in new
   problems.
6. Play bridge: The game makes you think, so if you are good at it you will be
   good in a lot of things.
7. Ask for advice: People might know where your judgment is not the strongest,
   so they might be able to help you to visualize the problems with your way of
   thinking.
8. Pick good people: Deciding to get into a partnership with Paul Allen is one
   of the best decisions he has made.
9. Don't procrastinate: To procrastinate is a bad habit in business. You should
   be organized.
10. Have a sense of humor.
