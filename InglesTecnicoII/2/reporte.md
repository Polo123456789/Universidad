How to become a software developer?
===================================

80% of developers have a bachelors degree in computer science or computer
Engineering. And you need add to add certifications in the new frameworks and
languages that keep coming out. And or course, you need experience. You can get
that from an internship, from building personal projects, or contributing to
open source software (If you can get a commit into the Linux kernel, you will
never be out of a job).

Do you think glass technology is possible?
==========================================

Going one by one:

1. **Photo voltaic glass:** That already exists, but the video doesn't show an
   accurate representation of it. It is like having a solar panel inside of the
   glass. So in the way the video shows it, is not possible.
2. **LCD Television Glass:** You probably have in your computer an LCD monitor,
   and it would be no different from the one in the video. So it is possible.
3. **Architectural Display Glass:** It already has been done, basically putting
   a screen behind the mirror. But the image quality that it shows in the video
   is not realistic, it is not possible (At least today).
4. **Architectural Surface Glass:** It already has been done, so it is possible.
5. **Appliance Veneer glass:** Its basically a giant tablet.
6. **Hand held Display glass:** Not possible as shown in the video, as it has
   no space for the internals (And if it had, they would be visible due to the
   transparent nature of glass).
7. **Hand Held to Surface Glass integration:** It is possible, but not in the
   way the video shows it, because the children continue the video call, but
   there is no camera on the table that points at them.
8. **Automotive display glass:** Its possible, its just putting a display on
   the car.

From the rest of the video, the only one that I think is not possible is the
flexible display glass.

The 3 items that got my attention where:

1. **Architectural display glass:** Because of the image quality
2. **Hand Held display glass:** Because its so small and thin
3. **Flexible display glass:** Because it just looks impossible
