and functions that you can download and install without the need to customize
or configure.

---

### Examples

1. A USB works OOTB.
2. Your apps should work OOTB, if you need your user to set it up and configure
   it manually, you are doing it wrong.

Server
======

### Definition

Computers running software that allows users to access your website — this is
what houses the hosting. If your domain is the website’s mailing address and
the hosting is its house, the server is the land it’s built on.

---

### Examples

1. For some reason the server is down.
2. We will need a new server, the website is getting too much traffic.

404
===

### Definition

Error message when what was requested cannot be found; often because the link
that was requested is either broken or dead.

---

---

### Examples

1. The site always returns a 404, I think the link is broken.
2. I hate when an API returns 200 even if something failed. No 500, no 404, no
   501, always 200.
